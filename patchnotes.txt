until 0.4 
bug fixes and better descriptions

0.5 
first new featre -> spawn new cells every X Iterations (if 0 dont)

0.6 
stable feature found and fixed bug with wrong oriantation

0.7 
Option to use plane instead of cube

0.8 Orthogonal Camera working now

1.0
- performance boost (now only new cells are created as new objects, previous cells stay alive and are not deleted)
	- previously about 8 sec per 500 cells and every cell was updated every frame
	- now only actually new cells are updated (which saves around 6 secs per frame with 500 cells )
- random color option
- Optional Camera disable (for custom settings like non squared gaming areas)
	- to animate your own camera, num frames = number iterations in that case
- colored Nodes in (green for new spawned)  -- maybe red for ones that will die ? -> requires future check
- still bugs

BIRTH CHANCE (the higher the more cells) -- add to description / DONE
Info about overriding highlight color with your own (and test that it works) / DONE

V1.3
MASSIVE performance boost when using planes. 
Now 1000 Planes take ~0.353 sec instead of ~60.286 sec!
Now created using vertecies and a face with from_pydata() instead of primitive_plane_add().
